            <h1>About MazdoorMitr</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>MazdoorMitr</strong> is built by Quickclap Solutions Pvt. Ltd. to empower blue-collar workers across India by connecting them directly with employers—no middlemen, no fuss. Our platform enables workers to earn while they’re discovered: for every employer’s view of their contact number, the worker earns ₹10.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of being just another job portal or directory, MazdoorMitr removes barriers. Labourers gain visibility, employers get access to reliable workers, and every transaction is transparent and fair. We’re all about trust, convenience, and opportunity.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                To create a fast, transparent, and user-friendly platform that transforms how blue-collar work opportunities are discovered and delivered across India.
            </p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide an intuitive website and mobile app experience for labourers and employers across India.</li>
                <li>Facilitate verified connections—labourers approve when their contact is shared, and earn for every profile view.</li>
                <li>Ensure wallet credits are transparent, secure, and withdrawable once a minimum threshold is met.</li>
                <li>Maintain a secure, OTP-authenticated login system—no KYC, just simple, safe access.</li>
                <li>Offer round-the-clock support for dispute resolution, complaints, and feedback.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why MazdoorMitr Matters</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deep Reach</strong>: Targeted especially at Tier II and III cities—places often underserved by existing job platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Fair Pay</strong>: Labourers are rewarded from day zero—₹10 for every view of their profile.</li>
                <li><strong>Built for Accessibility</strong>: Clean UI, multilingual support, and designed for users with low digital fluency.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Practices</strong>: No selling of user data, explicit consent for contact sharing, and grievance mechanisms in place.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>
                We’re continuously expanding: improving our regional reach, adding features like real-time job alerts, in-app chatting, and streamlined wallet payouts—all while maintaining our core values of fairness, safety, and empowerment.
            </p>
